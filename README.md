## General Info & Rules

* #### The game has two players.
* #### The player highlighted with purple color starts and when their turn ends the second player starts.
* #### Every turn, the player rolls the die by pressing "Roll Die".  
You can roll the die as many times as you want.  
Every roll is added to the round points indicated below the PLAYER text.  
* #### If a player rolls a "1", the round points are lost and the turn ends.
* #### A player can choose to "Hold Score" to save their round points.  
This will save their points to "Total Points" and the turn ends.
* #### Total points determine who wins the game.
You decide how many points that are required to win.
